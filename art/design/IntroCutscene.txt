2174 - New Atlantica City

After the catastrophic collapse of the East Euro-Asiatic Alliance in the late 21st century, large corporations capitalized on the power vacuum and used their vast wealth to wrest control from regional governments. 

ZantoCorp used bribery, propaganda, and the fears of populace to outmaneuver their competitors and become the ersatz rulers of most of the Eastern European region. Presently, they directly employ 56% of the workforce, making ZantoCorp the largest labor monopoly the world has ever seen.

Using city drones, integrated camera feeds, and data-sniffing, they maintain extensive dossiers on all Euro-Asiatic workers, and have nearly 100% complete records on all New Atlantica City residents. Most people live in relatively harmony with their corporate overlords. The have never been wealthier or better fed before. 

Not everyone is happy with the comprehensive monitoring and the brutal legal consequences for even minor offenses. 

Weldon Zemke is the leader of a small group of dissidents whose primary goal is to live in the New Atlantica City as ghosts. They use sophisticated electronic countermeasures to remain unseen by cameras, and to leave no lasting data trail. They call themselves the Zero-Footprint Society.
