Future Design Roadmap

---------------------------------------------

- Game should be combat-centric, not stealth-oriented
- Add Alarms
- Once alarm is triggered, it becomes a pure combat level
- View character status/equipment screen
- Characters should have stat growth, based on class plus innate
- Characters should be able to bring consumables
- After the early levels, player should be able to select his team and equip them before deploying for a mission
- Characters should be able to wear armor
- Armor should impact sound, movement and damage reduction
- Weapons should have accuracy ranges impacted by distance
- Characters should be able to equip perks later in the game
- Levels should have interactables
- Some interactables will grant new equipment, or power-up consumables, or currency
- After the early levels, players should have access to a shop, in between missions
- Game should have character perma-death
