## Preface

So yeah, I joined this totally blindly. I barely found out about MonoGame for a day or two, that I found out about the game jam, so this wasn't what I expected my 7 days of work to be, ye this was a wholesome experience. It only makes me want to force myself to learn this engine, because it does exactly what I want it to do: It's performant, easy enough to prototype something in, shit runs on every platform with DotNet Core, plus it's not Unity!

## 1) What went well

You guys were fun as hell to work with. I loved every moment we had.

I want to especially thank Theo and Zavik for their time helping me in times where I needed guidance. It helped immensely, and I can't thank you enough for that. Even if all I made was fairly small and some of the features I added weren't fully used (EDIT: Theo confirmed to me we did, nevermind about that, I just never realized), I'm still proud of what I made that was included in the game, knowing that this was the first time I developed on your MonoDragons.Core and on the MonoGame engine.

The game seems to have been praised by every close friends I've showed it to. For a 7 day project, this is spectacular. I mean shit, go on #general on the MGJAM discord server; They legit were like "How did they make this in a week? That's crazy!"

Oh yeah, and it turned out to be a great thing to mention during an interview I had yesterday for a mandate at a client of the company I work at. The guy totally could relate, and thought it was really cool that I participated in this of my own will as a way to train myself in the DotNet ecosystem.

## 2) What didn't go well

Oh, you know. Cover hovering. Saving. Those two things I was supposed to do which I struggled doing for the last two days. 

However, I know exactly why I struggled : First off, I had barely touched how Serialization worked in C#. Second of all, I was very unfamiliar with the most advanced extension methods for IEnumerables worked (Select, Where, Group, GroupJoin, Join, etc.) And I think if I knew better how they worked, I would have been very capable of delivering. 

I'm still disappointed I couldn't implement the CoverProvidedView after all the effort I put into it yesterday, but to be fair, I wasn't very experienced with the DotNet ecosystem before working on this. This has been a wake-up call that I still have a lot to learn, but that's a very good thing, and it's part of the life of programmer.

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward

 - I still need to ask questions more often, even after I think I can figure things out by myself; It's usually not stupid to start asking question if I start getting frustrated at a problem for a while.
 - I am now convinced that "Composition > Abstraction"; It was way more fun and easy to understand how to work on this project compared to some of the traditional OOP monolithical codebases I've worked on in the past.

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam

Watermelon and "YES" shitposting. I love you, Febucci. (full homo)

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game

The gameplay overall. It's such a cool take on XCOM, if we wanted to make this a real game, I'm sure it would have some following. I haven't finished the first level, but I'm def gonna play through the whole thing tonight (or now maybe?)

To quote Reggie Fils-Aime: 

> "The game... is fun."

## Final Thoughts

I'm definitely going to continue experimenting with MonoGame in my spare time. I might also do another GameJam in the near future, but that depends on how busy I'll be by then.
