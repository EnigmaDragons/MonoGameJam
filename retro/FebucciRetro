Febucci - Retrospective Notes

## The Good

- Amazing teamwork and sinergy.
- The "graphics tricks" that I do in Unity were also useful in MonoGame.
- Sprites packing was a *little bit* easier with the software that I used. 
- Amazing team energy, I had a lot of fun.
- I learned "Tiled" and was surprised how much it's easy to use with MonoGame.
- The "game feeling" is stunning, counting that it was made in only one week.
- I learned pixelated particles like rain, bullets and leaves (even if we didn't use them).
- I did sleep the right hours, without turning into a zombie at the end of the Jam.

## The Neutral

- We went for an "hard" game to realize, but in the end we did it.

## The Bad

- Some bugs, due the complexity of the game.
- I couldn't focus much on the Jam on the last two days.
- The "Jam Theme" was added later/in the end as a core mechanic.
- No explanation of the "overwatch" mode and the game in general.
- Sound/Audio wasn't ready until the very end of the Jam.

## What lessons can we take moving forward

- Organize on the tools and softwares compatibility (for example the Sprite Packing tool) before the Jam starts.
- Think and focus more on the Jam Theme and implement it since the beginning.
- Make a very intuitive game or add a simple tutorial at the beginning.
- I should eat more watermelons and drink more water during a Jam. Stay hydrated guys, always!

## What was my personal favorite part of the jam
(I'll write two parts and not one, okay? Okay.)

- I had a lot of fun and the team was/is awesome, helping each other and being happy, joking and so on.
- I loved the freedom that I had drawing the game and the team's support.

## What is my favorite thing in the game
- I really like the "game feeling".
