Silas Reinagel - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well

- Amazing energy, focus and effort from the team
- Biggest scope we've ever aimed for. Most work we've ever accomplished in a jam
- The Game looks amazing!
- General software architecture is very effective for a tactics game
- MonoTiled is really great, and effectively makes Tiled the Game World editor
- Communication between the team was very strong

## 2) What didn't go well

- The expected audio tracks weren't ready before the final hours of the jam
- Mutating collections caused countless bugs and sunk a lot of time
- Tooling around Spritesheets, Tsx, and art change management cost us a lot of time
- The GameState wasn't designed upfront and cleanly integrated
- The gameplay didn't really take shape, since we just finished the basic mechanics by the time the jam ended
- Scope was way too big
- I took the wrong days off work, since I got confused about what `Thursday midnight` meant

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward

- Don't try to put story in a Mechanics-oriented game jam, and don't try to put mechanics in a Story-oriented game jam
- Enforce usage of only immutable Collections everywhere. Project instead of mutate.
- Always create the GameState data structure and access/update flow before building anything else
- Would be useful to have Saving/Loading/Options/Fullscreen/BasicCredits pre-built in MonoDragons.Core
- Make sure to have Coconut Water and lots of extra protein inthe house before the jam begins

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam

- Building my first AI system
- State Management using pure Eventing
- Seeing the fake lights and world-tinting making the levels look so much richer

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game

- I absolutely love the aesthetic of the game. The UI, the levels, the characters. The setting is spot-on.
