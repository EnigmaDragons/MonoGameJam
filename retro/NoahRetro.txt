The Good: 

I think our eventing did make it extremely easy to add new systems
I loved how fun our fellow jammers were
We kept on adjusting focus remaining flexible about what we were building
We had much better participation in ticket and committing often than previous jams

The Bad: 

Non-Thread Safe data access (immutable structures)
Our base library does not have good samples
Event-Chains on the same update loop
Scoped too large as per usual
Doing logic in the draw loop
Some of the team bailed on us
We shipped with a critical bug
The build got broken multiple times
Our Error Handling when we started
The spritesheets in tiled games need astandarized way to pack

The Action: 

Eventing is terrific but consumers of events should only queue up there events
Don’t make modifications to lists reset them instead
Don’t logic in the draw loop
Always click play before pushing
