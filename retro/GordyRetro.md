# Gordy Keene - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well

- This was an excellent and completely enjoyable experience.
- For someone like me, with commitment issues, just doing QA was exactly the right way to dive in.
- It was awesome to see people leading through positive feedback, it did an excellent job of establishing a fun and enjoyable environment.

## 2) What didn't go well

- Having never used MonoGame before, it wasn't clear what I needed to do to be ready to test. It prevented me from getting started the very first night. Once it was explained, the actual setup was easy. I should have reached out sooner.
- Initially when reporting bugs, I was trying to filter them on what I thought the impact would be, and only mention those that I thought hugely impacting the game. But then I saw how fast they were being addressed, and realized I shouldn't filter. 
- On a few of my earlier bugs I may have spent too long gathering the details. By the time I had everything I thought needed, there had several more pushes, and I couldn't duplicate it any more, so those I continued to filter.
- This was my first time just trying to be QA, so it was hard to avoid jumping in and trying to "solve the bug." A few times I made that mistake, it consumed a chunk of time didn't really help since others were committing changes much faster than I could.
- Testing became a little tedious towards the end, when I was focused on testing the boss fight. Perhaps a way to save and reload game state, although that might be challenging as the game model is extended. Or perhaps a way to record and playback a series of player moves, but that might be challenging if the random state of the game is markedly different between runs. I guess I don't really know how to do this well.

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward

- When doing QA on a fast moving target, write things up quickly and move on.

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam

- The friendly banter in the discord channel.

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game

- I love many things about this game: Its visually stunning, the music is great, and as enemies come and go the audio transitions feel clean.
