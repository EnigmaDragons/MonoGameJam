### Game Concept

----

**Genre: Tactics Game**
**Flavor/Story: Cyberpunk: You are part of Zero-Footprint Society**

Big Idea:
- Your main character has a max amount of total steps before dead/game over
- Must break into a MegaCorp in order to remedy the situation/injection/trackers/etc

Features:
- UI display translucent fading footsteps behind where characters move
- Vision-based knowledge of combat areas. Lots of fog of war
- Player can "see-through" walls by observing visual footsteps indicators to determine where enemies are
- Some movement-style powers/abilities

### Jam Main Goals

----

1. Have fun!
2. Stretch yourself and try things you haven't done before
3. Iterate quickly, and don't worry about making things perfect
4. As a team, we want to deliver something complete and achievable

----

### Tiled Level Design Special Rules

----

**Map must have 6 layers, and can have any number of additional layers**

 * `[ Floors, Walls, UnderChar1, UnderChar2, OverChar1, OverChar2, PostFX1, PostFX2... ]`

**Custom Properties:**
* `Hide (bool)`
* `Blocking (bool)`
* `Cover (string)` Possible Values: `None/Light/Medium/Heavy`
* `FX (string)` Value format: `X_FXNAME_COLOR` X must be `o` or `n`

### Project Guidelines

----

- All work must happen against Github tickets.
- Ticket you are working on should be assigned to you and in the “In Progress” column
- Only work on 1, or at most, 2 tickets at a time
- If you wish to work on a ticket outside your role consult the PM or Design Lead first
- If a ticket is taking a lot more work than you expected, reach out to the group
- The Lead for each role makes all final decisions about his area of focus
- Every ticket that is finished should result in a Git commit with the new assets
- Any team member may create a ticket for work they think is needed
- All tickets should have a Role label
- You may push directly to `master` or open a PR and merge, if you prefer

### Artist Contributions

- Post sketchs and samples as you feel like in the jam chat channel
- All raw art artifacts should be committed into the `ArtSource` folder
- When the finished art is committed into `ArtSource` you may close the ticket

The sooner people see art, the better the team's ideas will be about the world, the flavor, and the design. So early reveals are great. Get the team excited about what you are creating!
